## Installation

- Make sure you have the Steam GFWL version of the game, as this is the only version this plugin is compatible with. (exe size of 4242504 bytes)
- Plop the files into your game folder, edit `FlatOutUCTimeTrialGhosts_gcp.toml` to change the options to your liking.
- Start the game and launch any race, you will now have a PB ghost to race against instead of AI opponents.
- Enjoy, nya~ :3
