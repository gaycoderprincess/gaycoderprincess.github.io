# v9.20

- Added support for converting Tough Trucks .cdb files to FlatOut 1 track_cdb.gen, auto-converting material IDs
- Converting FO2 maps to FO1 using `-convert_to_fo1` now converts missing materials to fallback ones
- Optimized FlatOut 1 cdb export a bit, still nowhere near perfect
- The program now throws a warning but doesn't terminate if the .toml file is missing
