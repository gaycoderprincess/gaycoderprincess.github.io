A complete overhaul of FlatOut with many quality-of-life features.

This mod was built from the ground-up with my own tooling, including single-handedly reverse-engineering the track format and the car model format.  

Designed with customizability in mind, this mod is open-source and includes many small improvements upon the game's code that come together to make adding your own changes a lot less of a hassle.

# Installation

- Make sure you have v1.1 of the game, as this is the only version this plugin is compatible with. (exe size of 2822144 bytes)
- Plop the files into your game folder.
- Enjoy, nya~ :3
  
# Features

- A brand new career mode based on FlatOut 2 with a cup system, finals for each class and proper progression
- A dynamic car list system that allows cars to be added or removed without having to change LUA scripts
- A new animated loading screen based on beta assets
- A new handling mode, Hardcore, which removes the arcadey handling elements and leaves you with more of a simcade feel
- A new music player written from the ground up, allowing multiple songs to play per race and more than one menu song
- A player list visible in-game that shows everyone's position
- Added health bars when close to your opponents
- Added nitro gain while airborne
- Added the ability to own multiple cars in Career mode

- All cars and tracks unlocked by default for Single Race mode

- Moved the transmission selection to the Options menu, allowing you to change it at any time
- New BFS loading system with filesystem and patch files that look more like FlatOut 2's

# Disclaimer

This mod is not and will never be compatible with the newest version of the game on Steam, as me and the team do not approve of or tolerate the actions of Strategy First and the ZOOM Platform in any way.  
All they have done in recent times is milk the last cents out of a dead horse for profit by selling a modpack commercially, shamelessly using the work of the community without permission such as in the case of xNyaDev's bfstool, dishing out empty promises of upcoming features, and making the games less stable for little to no actual benefit.  
Not to mention the lackluster Steam Workshop support which is now filled with low-effort reuploads of other people's mods, which are not even functional in some cases.  
If you have money to spare, please support the actual developers of the game. Go buy Wreckfest, get Wreckfest 2 when it releases, and if you want a FlatOut game, buy it used. Thanks.
