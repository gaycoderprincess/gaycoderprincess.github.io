A complete overhaul of FlatOut with many quality-of-life features.

This mod was built from the ground-up with my own tooling, including single-handedly reverse-engineering the track format, track collision format and the car model format.  
This makes this mod the first of its kind for the game, as fully custom tracks for any FlatOut game were completely impossible before.

I have also hacked the game itself to hell and back in order to allow for features such as online multiplayer, new gamemodes, seamless controller support, and a lot more. 
I've also added near-perfect support for ultrawide aspect ratios, including proper scaling of the menus, UI and in-game FOV.

Designed with customizability in mind, this mod is open-source and includes many small improvements upon the game's code that come together to make adding your own changes a lot less of a hassle.

# Installation

- Make sure you have v1.1 of the game, as this is the only version this plugin is compatible with. Note that the GOG release is structured entirely differently for whatever reason and is also incompatible.
- Plop the files into your game folder.
- If you get "Could not obtain native display resolution" on startup, remove d3d9.dll from the game folder.
- Enjoy, nya~ :3

# Disclaimer

This mod is not and will never be compatible with the newest version of the game on Steam, as me and the team do not approve of or tolerate the actions of Strategy First and the ZOOM Platform in any way.  
All they have done in recent times is milk the last cents out of a dead horse for profit by selling a modpack commercially, shamelessly using the work of the community without permission such as in the case of xNyaDev's bfstool, dishing out empty promises of upcoming features, and making the games less stable for little to no actual benefit.  
Not to mention the lackluster Steam Workshop support which is now filled with low-effort reuploads of other people's mods, which are not even functional in some cases.  
If you have money to spare, please support the actual developers of the game. Go buy Wreckfest, get Wreckfest 2 when it releases, and if you want a FlatOut game, buy it used. Thanks.
