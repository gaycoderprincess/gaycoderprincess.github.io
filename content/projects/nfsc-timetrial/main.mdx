A mod for Need for Speed: Carbon that replaces Quick Race opponents with TrackMania-like replays

This mod is also available for:
- [NFS Underground 2](https://gaycoderprincess.github.io/project/nfsug2-timetrial)
- [NFS Most Wanted](https://gaycoderprincess.github.io/project/nfsmw-timetrial)
- [NFS ProStreet](https://gaycoderprincess.github.io/project/nfsps-timetrial)

## Installation

- Make sure you have v1.4 of the game, as this is the only version this plugin is compatible with. (exe size of 7217152 bytes)
- Plop the files of your chosen variant into your game folder. (Practice for competing against yourself in quick races, ChallengeSeries for the time trial challenges)
- Start the game and launch any race, you will now have a PB ghost to race against instead of AI opponents.
- Enjoy, nya~ :3

## Features

- A built-in set of events in the Challenge Series to compete with other players on
- Drift scoring has been fixed, giving you the same amount of points regardless of whether you're using a controller or a keyboard, or have XtendedInput installed
- Ghosts are timed based on game ticks, meaning speedbreaker is timed in real-time, and the timebug no longer applies anymore
- Ghosts include a checksum of the player's game files, allowing you to check if someone's made any potentially unfair VLT modifications
- Ghosts include player inputs, and while they're not directly usable for playback (the game is not deterministic) it can still be used to verify legitimacy
- The mod includes a basic anti-cheat, preventing common methods of cheating
- The physics tickrate has been locked to 120, meaning Widescreen Fix no longer gives you an unfair advantage
