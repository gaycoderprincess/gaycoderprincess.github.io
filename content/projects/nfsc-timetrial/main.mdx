A mod for Need for Speed: Carbon that replaces Quick Race opponents with TrackMania-like replays

## Installation

- Make sure you have v1.4 of the game, as this is the only version this plugin is compatible with. (exe size of 7217152 bytes)
- Plop the files of your chosen variant into your game folder. (Practice for competing against yourself in quick races, ChallengeSeries for the time trial challenges)
- Start the game and launch any race, you will now have a PB ghost to race against instead of AI opponents.
- Enjoy, nya~ :3
