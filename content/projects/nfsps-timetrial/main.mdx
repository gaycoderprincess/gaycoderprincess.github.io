A mod for Need for Speed: ProStreet that replaces opponents with TrackMania-like replays

## Installation

- Make sure you have v1.1 of the game, as this is the only version this plugin is compatible with. (exe size of 3765248 or 28739656 bytes)
- Plop the files into your game folder.
- Start the game and press F5 to open the mod's menu and play the included Challenge Series.
- Enjoy, nya~ :3

Please note that due to the broken nature of this game, the main menu had to be made inaccessible, and game settings are not loaded! You'll have to change your control settings every time you relaunch the game

## Features

- A built-in set of events in the Challenge Series to compete with other players on
- Drift scoring has been fixed, giving you the same amount of points regardless of whether you're using a controller or a keyboard, or have XtendedInput installed
- Ghosts are timed based on game ticks, meaning the timebug no longer applies anymore
- Ghosts include a checksum of the player's game files, allowing you to check if someone's made any potentially unfair VLT modifications
- Ghosts include player inputs, and while they're not directly usable for playback (the game is not deterministic) it can still be used to verify legitimacy
- Resetting your car will immediately restart the race, TrackMania style (can be turned off in the settings)
- Tank Unslapper is included in the mod, enabled by default, and ghosts are cleanly separated by whether they have the steering delay removed or not
- The mod includes a basic anti-cheat, preventing common methods of cheating
- The physics tickrate has been locked to 120, meaning Widescreen Fix no longer gives you an unfair advantage
