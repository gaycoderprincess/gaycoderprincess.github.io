A complete overhaul of FlatOut UC that proves everyone's notions of "this game is unmoddable" dead wrong.

This mod was built from the ground-up with my own tooling, including single-handedly reverse-engineering the database format, the track format and the car model format.  
This makes this mod the first of its kind for the game, as custom cars for UC and fully custom tracks for any FlatOut game were completely impossible before.

I have also hacked the game itself to hell and back in order to bring back the majority of FlatOut 2's handling and allow for features such as non-GFWL multiplayer, new gamemodes, more than 8 car skins, up to 31 opponents, a rally mode with pacenotes, and a lot more. 
I've also added near-perfect support for ultrawide aspect ratios, including proper scaling of the menus, UI and in-game FOV. This comes with the neat side-effect of the menus no longer being stretched on 16:9 either!

Designed with customizability in mind, this mod is open-source and includes many small improvements upon the game's code that come together to make adding your own changes a lot less of a hassle.

# Installation

- Make sure you have the Steam GFWL version of the game, as this is the only version this mod is compatible with. (exe size of 4242504 bytes)
- Plop the files into your game folder.
- If you get "Could not obtain native display resolution" on startup, disconnect your second monitor.
- Enjoy, nya~ :3

# Disclaimer

This mod is not and will never be compatible with the newest version of the game on Steam, as me and the team do not approve of or tolerate the actions of Strategy First and the ZOOM Platform in any way.  
All they have done in recent times is milk the last cents out of a dead horse for profit by selling a modpack commercially, shamelessly using the work of the community without permission such as in the case of xNyaDev's bfstool, dishing out empty promises of upcoming features, and making the games less stable for little to no actual benefit.  
Not to mention the lackluster Steam Workshop support which is now filled with low-effort reuploads of other people's mods, which are not even functional in some cases.  
If you have money to spare, please support the actual developers of the game. Go buy Wreckfest, get Wreckfest 2 when it releases, and if you want a FlatOut game, buy it used. Thanks.
