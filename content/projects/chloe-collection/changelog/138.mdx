- Rebased all plugins onto [my new shared library of FOUC functions and types](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/nya-common-fouc)
- Redid all textures for all FO1, FO2, Retro Demo and Tough Trucks tracks & cars using [my new tool to fix washed-out textures](https://github.com/gaycoderprincess/FlatOutUCDDSFixer/releases), they should now be a lot more colorful and less dark
- Removed some Tough Trucks stages from the Stunt Show track list as they don't have enough jumps
