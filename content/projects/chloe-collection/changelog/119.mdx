# v1.19

- Added Redpine River, Whitefish Lake, Bay Circuit and Fairgrass Grounds from FO1
- Added custom preview images to the FO1 forest tracks
- Added unique preview images to the other FO1 pit tracks
- Added basic support for 21:9 aspect ratios
- Changed all FO1 track previews to new images with teddyator's textures
- Fixed the finish line in Finchley Challenge being misplaced
- Removed the FO1 menu music as it crashes the game (thanks Bugbear :3)
- Reconverted all FO1 tracks with better optimization, they should now be a lot more stable and have slightly better performance
- The Sadistic AI strength option now removes velocity caps, making early career mode a lot harder
