# v1.18

- Added the FlatOut 1 soundtrack as an option (not part of the combined playlist as it wouldn't fit the tone)
- Added a server-side option to disable props in multiplayer
- Added an in-game toggle for windowed mode
- Added a display for player ping in the multiplayer lobby
- Changed the cheat code and player name input menus to use the new in-game input window rather than the broken xliveless one
- Fixed all players being ghosted in multiplayer deathmatch derbies
- Fixed the menucar not updating when the host changes their car with the Same as Host car class
- Fixed players getting stuck in the waiting for host screen if they tab out during loading
- Multiplayer race starts are now properly synced up to the host, this should help with delayed starts
- Removed 50% upgrades from Time Trial mode as the ghost format only supports 0% and 100%
- The game now defaults to borderless windowed mode instead of fullscreen
- The launcher now no longer shows up if you've already configured your settings (it can still be opened using `-setup` as usual)
- The lobby lapcount display will now show the status of the player in first place rather than the host's lapcount
- The lobby lapcount display will now change to show the amount of players who have finished the race if there are any
