## Installation

- Make sure you have v1.2 of the game, as this is the only version this plugin is compatible with. (exe size of 2990080 bytes)
- Plop the files into your game folder, edit `FlatOut2CustomMP_gcp.toml` to change the options to your liking.
- If you're using Selo's Car Pack, copy the contents of the `for selo pack` folder into your game directory.
- Enjoy, nya~ :3

## Notes

- This plugin is currently only compatible with the vanilla game and Selo's Car Pack. Using it alongside any other large mods will lead to crashes.
- You must have port 23756 forwarded on your router if you intend to host a game.
